Hi #MastoAdmin and #ActivityPub developers 👋

I'm currently testing an OSSN-based social platform that federates via ActivityPub. Hashtags and Likes are received properly (via signed Create and Like activities), but replies to our posts aren't being received.

Here’s what I need help with:

✅ Our posts include a valid Note with:

to: https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public

url: pointing to our canonical post URL

id: full post URL (same as url)

published, attributedTo, etc.

🧩 When replying from Mastodon to one of our posts, the ActivityPub message does contain an inReplyTo with the full URL of the original post.

However:
❌ No Create activity with Note and inReplyTo is received on our inbox endpoint.
✅ We do receive Like, Undo, and Delete activities without problems.

Question:
👉 Under what exact conditions does Mastodon send a federated reply (as a Create with Note and inReplyTo) to the original post’s inbox?
Do we need to:

support Accept for incoming Follow?

add a cc field with the replier’s inbox?

expose a replies collection?

be whitelisted somehow?

Thanks for any pointers!
